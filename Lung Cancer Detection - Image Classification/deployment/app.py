    st.markdown('''
    The hospital faces a major difficulty in accurately diagnosing lung conditions from patient X-ray images. Specifically, it is difficult to predict whether a patient has a malignant, benign, or normal lung case based solely on the X-ray images. This diagnostic uncertainty can lead to delays in treatment, increased patient anxiety, and potentially inappropriate medical interventions. Addressing this issue is crucial to improving patient outcomes and ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis of lung conditions.

    st.write('#### üí° Objective')
    st.markdown('''
    The goal of this project is to create a `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` model that accurately predicts lung conditions from X-ray images. It will distinguish between **malignant**, **benign**, and **normal** cases, primarily using `accuracy` as the evaluation metric. This aims to improve diagnostics, patient outcomes, and reduce uncertainties in clinical settings.
