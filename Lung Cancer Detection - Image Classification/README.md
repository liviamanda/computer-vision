### **Problem Statement**

The hospital faces significant challenges in accurately diagnosing lung conditions from patient X-ray images. Specifically, predicting whether a patient has a malignant, benign, or normal lung condition based solely on X-ray images is difficult. This diagnostic uncertainty can lead to delays in treatment, increased patient anxiety, and potentially inappropriate medical interventions. Addressing this issue is crucial for improving patient outcomes and ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis of lung conditions.

The dataset for this analysis consists of X-ray images of patients' lungs with various conditions.

### **Objective**

The goal of this project is to develop a `Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)` model that accurately predicts lung conditions from X-ray images. The model will distinguish between malignant, benign, and normal cases, using `accuracy` as the primary evaluation metric. This aims to enhance diagnostics, improve patient outcomes, and reduce uncertainties in clinical settings through advanced **computer vision** techniques.

### **Project Output**

- **Jupyter Notebook for Model Training**: A comprehensive notebook documenting the data preparation, model design, training process, and evaluation metrics.
- **Jupyter Notebook for Model Inference**: A separate notebook for model inference, demonstrating how to use the trained model to predict lung conditions from new X-ray images.
- **Deployment**: Instructions or scripts for deploying the trained model, making it accessible for real-world application in clinical settings.
  
This README outlines the project goals, instructions, and tasks to provide a comprehensive evaluation of lung conditions using advanced computer vision techniques. By completing this project, the aim is to leverage the power of CNNs to assist in the early and accurate diagnosis of lung conditions, ultimately aiding healthcare professionals and improving patient care. The insights gained from this project will contribute to more effective and efficient diagnostic processes, benefiting both medical practitioners and patients.
